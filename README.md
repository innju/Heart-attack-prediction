# Prediction-of-heart-attack-risk
This analysis aimed to predict the risk of heart attack using classification model.
The python scripts are tested and run on Spyder (Python 3.8).

Thanks to the data contributor: Rashik Rahman

Main folder named heart_attack can be found at the repository page.
Click to see another two folders inside it, which are data and figures.
Data folder stored the raw data for this analysis.
Figures folder stored the figure of classification report,confusion matrix of the best model and the screenshot of the interface of application built.
The file used for training purposes is named as heart.attack.py
The file used for deployment purposes is named as heart_attack_deploy.py
In order to run the deployment files, you will need to run with the two pickle files included.
Best model is saved as best_model_forest.pkl and the Min Max Scaler involved also uploaded as mms.pkl

Best model identified for this analysis is the random forest, with accuracy of 75%.
